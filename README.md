# SWEN30006 Project 3



Notes - 
Some post codes missing between 3000-4000, this is because they do not exist. Need to check for this in API call.

API Call weather/locations - is implemented

TODO (add stuff here):
  - Add active flag like that in sample solution? As in, only use the stations that aren't represented by italics
  - Use time from BOM table instead of system time
  - Predictions
